# Ashen One: A Text Adventure Game

Ashen One is a web app that allows a user to play through a rogue-like text adventure. I wanted to build this game because Javascript is not generally considered an optimal language for building games, especially without a library. I wanted to show that someone who has never built a game before could do so without any of the tools associated with developing games.
