      | You decide to your only hope is to head north toward the old ford and the high pass. From there you will be able
      |to more easily reach Rivendell, and deliver the grave news to Isildurâ€™s youngest son, Valandil. As you sit silently
      |planning, hidden in a patch of tall grass and bushes, you hear a noise that makes your heart sink. Two harsh voices
      |speaking in a dark tongue peirce the silence of the night. To your relief, they are not born by fell wargs. You
      |realise that they are making their way toward your hiding space and you decide to act. You nock an arrow, aim, and
      |the loose it on one of the orcs. Your arrow hits its mark, and the orc falls lifeless onto the ground. Before you
      |can nock a second arrow, you hear a shriek. As you look up at your target, you see a dagger swiftly flying toward you.
      |You jump out of the way, barely dodging the dagger. Just as you get your bearings, you notice the orc charging you.
